#In this part I will develop my own function, to deal with some interesting math problem.

#I will write a function that calculate the area of a square or rectangle and tell if it is a square or a retangle.

    if side_a == side_b: #one property of the square is that the both sides are the same lenght.

    print('the area of a square side 5 and 5 should be 25. Result: ' + calculation(5,5))
    print('the area of a square side 11 and 11 should be 121. Result: ' + calculation(11,11))
    print('the area of a rectangle side 11 and 15 should be 165. Result: ' + calculation(11,15))

#First problem was the same as before, concatenating numbers with strings, since python does not do it implicitly, I will use the funcion 'str()'
#Some process was faster, since I use this tools a lot in this unit.
#I have learned to debbug my test with real examples, in the assetment, we should accomplish some tests, and I do it just like that.
#I learn some syntax of python, like not converting implictly numbers to string when concatenating.
#Other main subject learned is that the return token is resilient, and suport concatenation, function call, what made composition easier.
